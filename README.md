## Important notes: 

- To start the upload manually, press the URDS upload button. A short time later a toast message appears indicating whether the upload worked
- To enable/disable automatic upload, long press the URDS upload button. The automatic upload starts at 0:00 UTC with a random delay time (max. 120 minutes)
- The CSV log files originally created by the scanner plugin are saved under /web/logs/backup, all uploaded files are saved under /web/logs/sent after the upload
- Processing on the FMLIST server takes different amounts of time and only takes place if the OMID and email address match the FMLIST account details
